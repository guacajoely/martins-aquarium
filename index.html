            1. Provide Enough Space<br><br>

            One of the most important aspects of caring for a fish is ensuring it has sufficient space. According to the experts at Fishkeeping World, bigger is better when it comes to fish tanks. A large aquarium not only ensures your fish has ample room to swim, explore and grow, but it is also easier for you to maintain. Keeping the temperature and pH balanced is easier with a large tank than with a small one. <br><br>
            However, a larger tank also requires a bigger investment up front as well as higher maintenance costs. We recommend researching the minimum tank requirements for your chosen fish species and then investing in the largest tank you can afford.<br><br><br>

            2. Keep the Water Balanced<br><br>

            It is essential that you keep the water in your fish tank within the appropriate pH levels for your fish. If the water becomes too alkaline or too acidic it could be fatal to your fish. Before you go about balancing your fish tank, research the ideal pH level for your fishâ€™s species as each breed has different environmental requirements.<br><br>

            The pH levels in your fish tank will shift naturally over time as water evaporates or items are added or removed from the fish tank. This is why you must test the pH levels regularly. Fortunately, there are ways to raise and lower pH levels naturally rather than with chemicals. Adding items like moss or driftwood is often sufficient for bringing the water back to safe levels.<br><br><br>
